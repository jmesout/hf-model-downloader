# Trivy Ignore File
#
# This file contains CVEs that are intentionally ignored from security scans.
# Each ignored CVE should include:
# 1. The CVE identifier
# 2. A comment explaining why it's ignored
# 3. A date when the exception should be reviewed
#
# Example:
# # CVE-2023-12345 - False positive for Python stdlib, fixed in upstream
# # Review: 2025-03-01
# CVE-2023-12345

# Add ignored CVEs below this line with justification
